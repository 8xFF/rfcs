- Start Date: (fill me in with today's date, YYYY-MM-DD)
- RFC PR: [8xff/rfcs#0000](https://github.com/8xff/rfcs/pull/0000)

# Summary
[summary]: #summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

# User Benefit

How will users (or other contributors) benefit from this work? What would be the
headline in the release notes or blog post?

# Design Proposal

This is the meat of the document, where you explain your proposal. If you have
multiple alternatives, be sure to use sub-sections for better separation of the
idea, and list pros/cons to each approach. If there are alternatives that you
have eliminated, you should also list those here, and explain why you believe
your chosen approach is superior.

Make sure youâ€™ve thought through and addressed the following sections. If a section is not relevant to your specific proposal, please explain why, e.g. your RFC addresses a convention or process, not an API.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

# Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?

# Future possibilities
[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would
be and how it would affect the project as a whole in a holistic
way. Try to use this section as a tool to more fully consider all possible
interactions with the project in your proposal.
Also consider how this all fits into the roadmap for the project
and of the relevant sub-team.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the
RFC you are writing but otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities,
you may simply state that you cannot think of anything.

Note that having something written down in the future-possibilities section
is not a reason to accept the current or a future RFC; such notes should be
in the section on motivation or rationale in this or subsequent RFCs.
The section merely provides additional information.
